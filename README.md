- :star: I'm a fourth year computer engineering student who doen't like playing games but prefers making games that **AI** can play.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several **machine learning** projects.
- ðŸŒ± And along with it, Iâ€™m currently learning more about AI World and it's concepts.
- :snowflake: I'm looking to collaborate on any **AI related research work**.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through **[Email](chaudharymuskaan19@gmail)**
- âš¡ A fun fact about me is that i *never won a single ludo game.*

##### I've opted for OpenCV

I'm not an expert for this nor a complete beginner as during my internship with *CodeSpeedy tech pvt ltd*, i was given a project on *object detection* which takes several functions of **opencv**.
I know basic opencv modules like:
  1. **Image processing**
    * *object detection*
    * *drawing functions*
    * *color maps*
  2. **Machine Learning**
    * *ANN*
    * *naive bayes*
    * *decision tree*
  3. ***Image file reading and writing***
  
  4. ***Video I/O***
  
  > I also have complete knowledge of python from data base to modules like collection etc.
  
  > I wanted to opt for python or ML to begin with but till i was given a chance to fill the form they were no longer in choice.
